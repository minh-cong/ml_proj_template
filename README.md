Machine Learning Framework
This repository provides a machine learning framework designed to quickly and effectively solve real-world problems and Kaggle competitions. The framework is inspired by the methodologies and best practices outlined in the book "Approaching (Almost) Any Machine Learning Problem" by Abhishek Thakur.

Overview
The framework is built to streamline the process of developing machine learning models, from data preprocessing to model evaluation. It is particularly useful for tackling a wide range of machine learning problems, including classification, regression, and more.

Key Features
Modular Design: The framework is structured to be modular, allowing you to easily swap out components or extend functionality as needed.

Rapid Prototyping: Quickly iterate through different models and hyperparameters to find the best solution for your problem.

Best Practices: Incorporates industry-standard techniques and strategies for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

Kaggle-Ready: Designed with Kaggle competitions in mind, making it easier to apply the framework to real-world datasets and challenges.

Getting Started
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/minh-cong/ml_proj_template.git
cd ml_proj_template
